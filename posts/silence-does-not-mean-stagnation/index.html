    <p>It's been over a year since I last wrote something on this blog. At the end of
2016, when I returned from <a class="reference external" href="https://recurse.com">the Recurse Center</a>, I told
myself I will be blogging about all new things I learn or experiment with -
cause that's a good way to organize ones thoughts. Anyway, good habits
require at least 2 things: will and time. I wouldn't say I don't have any of
those but in the end I did not write anything for a whole year!</p>
<p>One of the major factors that kept me silent was my new job. At the end of
October in 2017 I started working with <a class="reference external" href="https://maidsafe.net">MaidSafe</a> on a
peer-to-peer privacy and security oriented <a class="reference external" href="https://safenetwork.tech">data network</a>. The peer-to-peer technology was totally new to
me as a programmer. Also, most of our code is written in Rust which I didn't
have professional experience with. On top of that, I started working remotely
and that was another thing I've never done before. So, I've kept myself quite
busy and couldn't find enough time to properly log some of my discoveries :)</p>
<section id="work-at-maidsafe"><h2>Work at MaidSafe</h2>
<p>One of the nice things about working at MaidSafe is that everything is open
source. You can even go and checkout out what I've been doing <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/povilasb">today</a> :) At MaidSafe I'm mainly working on the p2p
networking library called Crust which puts into use a number of other libraries.
I will mention only those that I've made a fair amount of contributions.</p>
<section id="p2p"><h3>p2p</h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ustulation/p2p/">p2p</a> is a Rust library that does TCP and
UDP hole punching. Hole punching is a technique that makes direct connections
possible between two peers that are behind routers with Network Address
Translation. This topic deserves a blog post of it's own that I will probably
write some time soon. p2p is a very important library for peer-to-peer
connections and is integrated into Crust. I made sure the integration was
smooth and was one of the library maintainers.</p>
</section><section id="tokio-utp"><h3>tokio-utp</h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maidsafe/tokio_utp">tokio-utp</a> is another Rust networking
library. It implements uTP protocol in pure Rust and exposes Tokio/futures
based API. uTP protocol adds reliability logic on top of UDP protocol. It also
describes the expected congestion control mechanism that yields to other
network traffic in the system. I took over the maintenance of this library from
ex developers. I did a lot of investigation on how congestion control was
implemented, I worked on graceful connection shutdown, improved test coverage
and code quality in general.</p>
</section><section id="rust-libutp"><h3>rust-libutp</h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maidsafe/tokio_utp">tokio-utp</a> was written from scratch
and at that time it wasn't as stable as people would like it to be. As a
result, I wrote the wrappers for the libutp which is C implementation of uTP
protocol. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bittorrent/libutp">libutp</a> is the mainstream
implementation and is supposed to be robust and stable. That was the first time
I wrote C bindings for Rust, hence learned something new. I have to say it was
quite easy: Rust has this tool <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen">bindgen</a> that automatically
generates Rust wrappers for a given C header file. The generated wrappers are
unsafe so I did have to provide safe API on top of. Anyway, work is still in
progress there.</p>
</section><section id="crust"><h3>Crust</h3>
<p>Most of my time I spent working on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maidsafe/crust">Crust</a>
library. It's a peer-to-peer communications library written in Rust. It
supports multiple transport protocols (TCP and uTP at this moment), encryption,
hole punching, etc. I did some work to integrate tokio and futures crates into
Crust, greatly expanded automated test suite, implemented examples, expanded
documentation and maintained library overall quality.</p>
<p>I also did some minor changes to MaidSafe encryption libray
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_crypto/commits?author=povilasb">safe_crypto</a>
and carried safe_crypto integration into Crust.</p>
</section><section id="netsim"><h3>netsim</h3>
<p>Testing peer-to-peer networking code is hard, especially the hole punching
implementation. As a result my collegue <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/canndrew">Andrew</a>
created a library that simulates computer networks with Rust - <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/canndrew/netsim">netsim</a>. It runs completely in memory and gives
you a full control over the simulated network: you can construct hierarchical
networks, exchange IP packets, introduce packet loss and latency, simulate misc
network address translation behaviors, etc.
I mostly tested the library from the user perspective and gave my feedback.
In addition, I did some minor
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/canndrew/netsim/commits?author=povilasb">contributions</a>
and since this is such an amazing tool I did a couple of presentations at our
local events in Lithuania: <a class="reference external" href="https://2018.notrollsallowed.com/pranesimai/60">no trolls allowed 2018</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.meetup.com/Rust-in-Vilnius/events/254403141/">Vilnius Rust meetup</a> :)</p>
</section></section><section id="open-source-projects"><h2>Open Source Projects</h2>
<p>Besides my daily job I usually tend to spend some time on my personal or
other open source projects. A lot of times the work I do for the companies
influences my interests after work too.</p>
<p>A year ago I did some UDP and TCP hole punching experiments using python.
The code is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/povilasb/hole-punching">here</a>.
I also wrote a command line utility to forward ports in your router:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/povilasb/pyigd">https://github.com/povilasb/pyigd</a> which I actively use to this day.</p>
<p>At MaidSafe I work with Rust on a daily basis where we use a lot of open source
libraries. During the last year I did some small contributions to some of them.
I added boolean matchers to rust hamcrest library:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ujh/hamcrest-rust/commits?author=povilasb">https://github.com/ujh/hamcrest-rust/commits?author=povilasb</a> . Unfortunately,
the development of hamcrest-rust got frozen. But then an active <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Valloric/hamcrest2-rust">fork</a> emerged which accepted a small
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Valloric/hamcrest2-rust/pull/4">PR of mine</a>. I made
<cite>contains()</cite> matcher generic which allowed it to accept single element or
vector.  Hence <cite>assert_that!(vec![1, 2, 3], contains(2))</cite> became possible.
Another rust library I contributed to is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbstp/rust-igd">rust-igd</a> which implements <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Gateway_Device_Protocol">IGD protocol</a>. I added
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sbstp/rust-igd/pull/33">an asyncronous use example</a>.
Finally, I made a tiny <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cespare/vim-toml/pull/41">PR</a>
into <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cespare/vim-toml">vim-toml</a> which is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML format</a> highlighting for vim. Unfortunately the
PR did not get merged yet.</p>
